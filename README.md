This is the source code for the gauculator.

Designed to send email notifications to Tufts Students who want to know when and where the next time General Gau's Chicken will be served

The countdown is a live countdown to the next time there will be Gau

To Do:
Functional backend, currently no way to sign up
Live countdown clock (I manually set the first date)
Align countdown clock for responsive design
Location box for where the next Gau will be
Code to scrape the dining website for future Gau dates

Future:
Expand to beyond Gau's
